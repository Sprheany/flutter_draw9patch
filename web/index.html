        <h2>Welcome to the online draw 9patch editor. <a href="/editor.html">Try it now!</a></h2>
        <p>
            The Draw 9patch editor is an online WYSIWYG tool similar to the one in Android Studio. The tool lets you
            create bitmap images that automatically resize to accommodate the contents of the view and the size of the
            screen. You can scale selected parts of the image horizontally or vertically based on indicators drawn
            within the image.
        </p>

        <img src="/images/fig1.png" alt="" width="680" />

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            Follow these steps to create a NinePatch graphic using the Draw 9patch editor. You'll need an image that
            you'd like to create a NinePatch image from.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the <strong>Select image</strong> button or drag the image into the editor that you want to create
                a NinePatch image from.
                <p>
                    In the workspace that opens, the center pane is your drawing area, where you can edit the lines for
                    the stretchable patches and content area. The right pane is the preview area, where you can preview
                    your graphic when stretched.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Change filename for your NinePatch image. Your image will be saved with the
                <code translate="no" dir="ltr">.9.png</code> file extension.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click within the 1-pixel perimeter to draw the lines that define the stretchable patches and (optional)
                the content area.
            </li>
            <li>When done, click the <strong>Save image</strong> button to save your changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            To make sure that your NinePatch graphics scale down properly, verify that any stretchable regions are at
            least 2x2 pixels in size. Otherwise, those regions may disappear when scaled down. To avoid interpolation
            during scaling that may cause the color at the boundaries to change, provide 1 pixel of extra safe space in
            the graphics before and after stretchable regions.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> A normal PNG file (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">*.png</code>) is loaded with an
            empty 1-pixel border added around the image. You can draw the stretchable patches and content area within
            the border. A previously saved NinePatch file (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">*.9.png</code>) is loaded
            as-is, with no drawing area added because it already exists.
        </p>

        <h2>Optional Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Adjust the zoom level of the graphic in the drawing area.</li>
            <li><strong>Patch scale</strong>: Adjust the scale of the images in the preview area.</li>
            <li><strong>Show lock</strong>: Visualize the non-drawable area of the graphic on mouse-over.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Show patches</strong>: Preview the pink stretchable patches in the drawing area. Pink indicates
                a stretchable patch, as shown in figure 2.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Show content</strong>: Highlight the content area in the preview images. Purple indicates the
                area where content is allowed, as shown in figure 2.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Show bad patches</strong>: Adds a red border around patch areas that may produce artifacts in
                the graphic when stretched, as shown in figure 2. If you eliminate all bad patches, you will maintain
                the visual coherence of your stretched image.
            </li>
